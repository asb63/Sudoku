## experimental  ##

    * This is one way I have been experimenting with making the sudoku board.
    * Uses css grid instead of the more logical 'table'
    * This is a way I considered making the original table in the /baseline/ code.
    * I chose a standard html table instead since it was most intuitive and easy to write.
