## experimental - DOESN'T WORK ##

* I have never used react.
* There are many things I come across while learning which seem useful
* This is where I will attempt to use the react-table "headless" library

## Thoughts ##

* This library appears to be targetting those who wish to present large ammounts of data.
* I may find it to be too complicated for my needs.
* Otherwise, this may be a very simple way to create a "sudoku-table" which can be re-used
* I believe the custom hooks provided by the library can provide convenient ways to access/manipulate the table.

* Needs to be consistently sized. 
* Always 9x9 square matrix 'table' no exceptions.
* Editable
* Appears to require data to make table, so MOCK_DATA.JSON exist in this folder as a sample

## Problems ##

* react-table seems to work better with different shapes of data
* I have 81 cells to show in 9 rows
* 9 rows of data in a table are typically 9 individual table elements
* I must change the data structure or learn how to adapt react-table
